<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello! I'm Leonardo Bione dos Anjos, a passionate individual with a unique blend of expertise in both Law and Information
   Technology. Although I graduated in Law, my journey led me to discover my true calling in the tech world. My previous role
   as a tax consultant at a multinational consulting and auditing firm equipped me with a keen analytical mindset and a solid
   foundation in problem-solving.</p>

<p>Currently, I am diving deep into the world of front-end development, honing my skills in HTML with a commitment to continuous
   learning. I am excited to showcase my projects that reflect my growing expertise in this area. My first project not only marked
   the beginning of my foray into HTML but also laid the groundwork for my journey into creating interactive and engaging web experiences.</p>

<p>With a creative spirit and a dedication to blending aesthetics with functionality, I am eager to explore new challenges and
   opportunities in the tech realm. Thank you for visiting my portfolio, and I look forward to connecting with fellow enthusiasts
   and potential collaborators!</p>
